# Tech-Blog

This is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This was built completely from scratch and deployed it to Heroku. The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

# Technologies used:

- Node JS
- Express JS
- Sequelize
- Bcrypt
- MySQL
